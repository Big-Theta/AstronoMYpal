This app was an attempt to make an astronomical observation log for use in completing [Astronomical League Observing Programs
](http://www.astroleague.org/observing.html), such as the [Caldwell Program](http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/caldwell/cldwl.html) (currently the only included dataset).

AstronoMYpal was programmed by the three of us over a period of ten hours at the EECS WSU Hackathon on October 19, 2013.

Overall, the backend functionality exists for recording the viewing sessions and getting achievements, but the front-end still needs work to display everything.

It may go somewhere, it may not. We do want an app that is useful for this, but it may just be treated as a prototype.
